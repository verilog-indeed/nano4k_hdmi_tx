Open-source HDMI/DVI transmitter for the Gowin GW1NSR-powered Tang Nano 4K

RTL written in Verilog with some help from Gowin's OSER10 blocks, currently displays a PAL test pattern.

Hardwired to a 720x480@60Hz resolution, 24-bit color, currently transmitts a forwards-compatible DVI signal.

Work in Progress: currently working on loading an image from the onboard SPI flash.
